      <h3><em>Hobbies</em></h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy doing many different out door activities such as , Hiking,
        Kyaking, fishing, boating, tubing, and camping. I am also very
        competitive so I like to participate in any game with friends. Yet,I
        spend most of my spare time with my family. I have recently got into
        programming, so I do spend alot of time making programs to satisfy my
        creative urges. I find alot of joy in creating programs and after three 
        degrees I feel much more confident about my skills as a software engineer.
        I have an Associates of Arts & Science from Souther State Community College.
        An Applied Associates in Computer Information Systems and Software Development
        from Sinclair Community College. A Bachelors of Scienece in Software Development from
        Western Governors University, along with many certifications.
